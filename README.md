**Village Builder**

VillageBuilder is a website for facilitating sharing that is modeled on the cohousing concept. The website combines features of a classified ads website and a social networking website. It promotes efficient use of time and resources while strengthening community and social relationships.

For more information about the project, see [this PDF](http://johnmeinken.com/portfolio/files/VillageBuilder.pdf).

This project is currently on hold.  Check back later or contact me if you're interested.
